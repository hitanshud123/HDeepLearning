# HDeepLearning

This program builds a CNN model in Python from scratch.  
Matrix.py handles the matrix multiplication involved.  
Layer.py creates each layer in the CNN.  
NeuralNetwork.py is the main file that creates the model.  
  
  

Check out the digitClassifierExample folder to see how a new model can be created, trained, and used to classify digits.
